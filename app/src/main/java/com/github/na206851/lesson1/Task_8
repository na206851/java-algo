Question:
Write conclusion how type extension occurs in case of positives and negatives.

Solution:
Type cast less to more happens implicity because the smaller lies within the range of the larger
    example: byte 00000101(2) -> short 00000000_00000101(2)

When casting from higher to lower types, the most significant bits are discarded, so the number is lost
    example: int 1_00000000_00000001(2) -> short 00000000_00000001(2)
